## Exploratory Data Analysis
This project includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand and preprocess the MNIST dataset effectively.

# Load and Inspect Dataset:
The dataset is loaded using TensorFlow keras datasets.
Basic information about the dataset is displayed.

# Visualize Dataset:
Sample images from each class are displayed to give an overview of the dataset.

# Class Distribution:
The distribution of classes in the dataset is plotted to understand the balance of the dataset.

# Basic Statistics:
Basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation) of image pixel values are calculated.

# Check for Missing or Corrupt Data:
The dataset is checked for any missing labels or corrupt images to ensure data quality.

#Data Preprocessing:
Images are normalized.
Sample images before and after preprocessing are displayed to visualize the preprocessing steps.
